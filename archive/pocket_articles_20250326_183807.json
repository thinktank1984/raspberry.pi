This month’s focus is outreach—making and maintaining friendships. In this post, I’ll share lessons from the eight books I read on this topic. Next week, I’ll share my personal reflections on this month’s work.\n\nFor those interested, my notes from the previous months are available here:\n\n1.     Fitness:\n\nStart\n\n,\n\nEnd\n\n,\n\nBooks\n\n.\n\n2.     Productivity:\n\nStart\n\n,\n\nEnd\n\n,\n\nBooks\n\n.\n\n3.     Money:\n\nStart\n\n,\n\nEnd\n\n,\n\nBooks\n\n.\n\n4.     Food:\n\nStart\n\n,\n\nEnd\n\n,\n\nBooks\n\n.\n\n5.     Reading:\n\nStart\n\n,\n\nEnd and Books\n\n.\n\n1-Minute Summary of What I Learned\n\nHere are some quick takeaways from the eight books I read:\n\nGood friends keep you healthier.\n\nPeople with better social networks live longer, and the health impacts of loneliness and isolation are in the same ballpark as well-known dangers such as smoking cigarettes.\n\nAcquaintances matter too.\n\nAlthough the focus for most of us is on having deep friendships, there’s a whole literature on the role of “weak ties,” or people you rarely see, being *more* important for finding job opportunities or word-of-mouth opportunities.\n\nFriendship isn’t fast.\n\nEstimates on the time required for people to become friends is on the order of 60+ hours of in-person contact. This threshold explains why you can socialize frequently, yet still fail to make friends—if you don’t have sustained opportunity to socialize with the same people over and over, many potential friendships drop off before they hit the 60+ hour threshold.\n\nIt’s better to be interest\n\ned\n\nthan interest\n\ning\n\n.\n\nPeople are egocentric. We like people who like us, who take an interest in our interests and who really want to listen.\n\nDemocracy itself may be at stake.\n\nSince the 1960s, community and civic life have withered from their post-WWII peak. This decay of social infrastructure may be a major reason for our collective distrust and polarization.\n\nOverall I found this topic much deeper than I had expected, leading to some personal realizations which I’ll discuss next week. Now, some notes on each of the books I read…\n\n8 Books on Making Friends\n\n1.\n\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People\n\nby Dale Carnegie\n\nEvery once in awhile, a self-help book becomes so popular that it becomes a free-floating meme, detached from its actual content. Carnegie’s classic belongs in that rare genre of books which you probably feel like you’ve read—even if you haven’t.\n\nWhile the book has dozens of chapters articulating specific strategies for dealing with people, they all basically boil down to a simple observation: most people are egocentric. If you can adopt the other person’s perspective, and give them what they genuinely want, you’ll have smoother social interactions than if you focus directly on what you want.\n\nThe book definitely shows its age in a few places, such as a charming anecdote about a manager complimenting his secretary’s appearance, but the advice needs few updates because human nature hasn’t changed since Carnegie first wrote it.\n\n2.\n\nFriendship\n\nby Lydia Denworth\n\nI enjoyed this wide-ranging book discussing the science of friendship. The topics covered are eclectic, so it’s difficult to summarize adequately. Denworth’s investigation of friendship ranges from in-depth discussion of monkey communities, to the health impacts of loneliness, to whether or not Facebook is good or bad for society.\n\n3.\n\nSupercommunicators\n\nby Charles Duhigg\n\nDuhigg, a journalist whose previous work includes bestsellers on habits and productivity, tackles social skills in\n\nSupercommunicators\n\n. The idea is drawn from the observation that some people are consistently better in their ability to make friends than others, and that this skill is learnable to some degree.\n\nA central idea of this book is that essential communication depends on understanding what kind of conversation the other person wants to have and ensuring you match them in that desire. Duhigg argues for three broad types of conversations: practical (What are we going to do?), emotional (How do we feel about it?), and identity (Who are we?), and that attempts to dialogue often derail when people don’t successfully synchronize this.\n\n4.\n\nNever Eat Alone\n\nby Keith Ferrazzi\n\nI first read this book shortly after it came out in 2005. I think Ferrazzi does a good job of practically explaining how super-networkers, such as himself, manage to meet so many people and maintain so many relationships. One key insight I enjoyed revisiting was his explanation that relationships are muscles which strengthen through use, not bank accounts where favors can be saved up for a rainy day.\n\nWhile I found this book useful, it’s probably not the best book to persuade someone of the value of networking if they already find the practice off-putting. I think guides that focus on friendship and service are probably better to adopt as a mindset than the ambition-orientation that suffuses this book.\n\n5.\n\nWe Should Get Together\n\nby Kat Vellos\n\nVellos writes about how hard it is to make friends in big cities. People are abundant, yet genuine connection is often rare and fleeting.   This book was interesting, although probably aimed more at an earlier chapter in my life when I was often newly in a big city with ample time for socializing but struggling with the revolving door of temporary friendships.\n\nStill, I think Vellos addresses a genuine need for a lot of people, and her advice is practical and useful.\n\n6.\n\nGetting to Yes\n\nby Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton\n\nNegotiation is a central part of all relationships. From diplomatic conferences to deciding where to go for dinner, we’re always in a delicate dance of conflicting interests and desires.   The authors argue that most people make the mistake of bargaining over positions, like hagglers at a street market who keep stating their “best price” until they either make a deal or walk away. The uncomfortable conflict this creates causes some people to go hard, trying to squeeze the other person at the risk of the relationship, or go soft, trying to accommodate at the risk of failing to get what you really want.\n\nInstead, the authors suggest we should negotiate on principles, not positions. Separate the people from the problem; focus on your interests, not your position itself; look for options for mutual gain; and when you have to compromise, look for objective standards and principles to determine fairness.\n\n7.\n\nThe Art of Gathering\n\nby Priya Parker\n\nA good book opens you to a new way of thinking. Parker’s book definitely did that for me. Before reading this, not once had I ever considered hosting a dinner party or social event with the mindset Parker espouses.\n\nParker’s key to throwing successful parties is to define a clear (and debatable) purpose and have everything tailored to that outcome. That means the venue, guest list and even the rules of the party (she thinks a good host should have and enforce them) should all work to achieve the gathering’s stated purpose.\n\nDefinitely a must-read if you want to have an important event and aren’t sure the right way to go about it.\n\n8.\n\nBowling Alone\n\nby Robert Putnam\n\nCivic participation and communal life in America have been declining for decades, and the decay in our social infrastructure is showing.   Armed with hundreds of charts and statistics, Putnam walks through various measures of social decline from club membership, church attendance, volunteerism, political activism, and even picnics. Across the board, people are spending less time connected to their community than they were during the heyday of communal life in the 1960s.\n\nThis decline is epitomized in the title of the book: at the time of its writing, more people than ever were bowling, but there were far fewer bowling\n\nleagues\n\n.\n\n1\n\nIn this decline, Putnam sounds a warning about the health of American society. Places with lower measures of social capital have worse social outcomes: less civic participation, less trust in government, higher crime and worse health. Communal interaction builds generalized trust, which acts as a social lubricant making transacting with strangers easier and safer.\n\n2\n\nUnfortunately, it hardly seems like we’ve reached the nadir of Putnam’s social capital decline. Putnam blaming the entertainment value of television for causing the decline in social gathering now seems almost quaint when we have always-on, algorithmically-mediated entertainment in our pockets at all times.\n\nWhile the message may be a bit of a downer, I still found this book enormously useful in reshaping my perspective on socializing. There’s value in belonging to communities, not merely circles of friends. Clubs and organizations that bring people together from different strata of society are both valuable and necessary.\n\n_ _ _\n\nThat’s it for books this month. Next week, I’ll share some personal reflections on how I’ve improved my own outreach this past month as well as my plans for the future.\n\nFootnotes\n\nPutnam himself notes that the term “bowling alone” should be taken with poetic license. People probably *are* bowling with friends. But with fewer leagues, these informal and spontaneous gatherings are not a substitute for the larger assembly of social capital created by bringing people from different walks of life together in organized leagues and clubs.\n\nAs a side note, as I read this book shortly after the recent US election, it seems impossible not to connect Putnam’s words about the potential damage of declining social trust and the recent political climate.\n\nBest Articles\n\nBest Learning\n\nBest Habits\n\nBest Goal Setting\n\nBest Life Philosophy\n\nBest Career\n\nBest Feeling Better\n\nBest Thinking Better\n\nBest Productivity\n\nBest Books\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAre We Losing the Ability to Read Books?\n\nA Gallup poll shows we're reading fewer books each year.

Compared to the previously released Qwen2.5-VL series models, the features of this 32B VL model are as follows:\n\nResponses More Aligned with Human Preferences\n\n: Adjusted the output style to provide more detailed, better-formatted answers that align more closely with human preferences.\n\nMathematical Reasoning\n\n: Significant improvement in the accuracy of solving complex mathematical problems.\n\nFine-grained Image Understanding and Reasoning\n\n: Enhanced accuracy and detailed analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual logic deduction.\n\nPerformance\n\n#\n\nExtensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art (SoTA) models of comparable scale,\n\nQwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct\n\nhas demonstrated superiority over baselines, e.g., Mistral-Small-3.1-24B and Gemma-3-27B-IT, even surpassing the larger\n\nQwen2-VL-72B-Instruct\n\n.

b^2} $。\n\n代入 $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $，得到：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\implies c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a.\n\n$$\n\n又因为 $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} $，代入 $ b = 2 $，得到：\n\n$$\n\n\\sqrt{a^2 - 4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a.\n\n$$\n\n平方两边：\n\n$$\n\na^2 - 4 = \\frac{3}{4} a^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{4} a^2 = 4 \\implies a^2 = 16 \\implies a = 4.\n\n$$\n\n因此，椭圆的方程为：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{y^2}{16} + \\frac{x^2}{4} = 1.\n\n$$\n\n第二步：直线 $ l $ 的方程\n\n#\n\n直线 $ l $ 过点 $ F(0, t) $，设其斜率为 $ k $，则直线 $ l $ 的方程为：\n\n$$\n\ny = kx + t.\n\n$$\n\n第三步：直线 $ l $ 与椭圆的交点\n\n#\n\n将直线方程 $ y = kx + t $ 代入椭圆方程 $ \\frac{y^2}{16} + \\frac{x^2}{4} = 1 $，得到：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{(kx + t)^2}{16} + \\frac{x^2}{4} = 1.\n\n$$\n\n整理得：\n\n$$\n\n(kx + t)^2 + 4x^2 = 16 \\implies k^2x^2 + 2ktx + t^2 + 4x^2 = 16 \\implies (k^2 + 4)x^2 + 2ktx + t^2 - 16 = 0.\n\n$$\n\n这是关于 $ x $ 的二次方程，设其两根为 $ x_1 $ 和 $ x_2 $，则交点 $ C(x_1, y_1) $ 和 $ D(x_2, y_2) $ 的横坐标分别为 $ x_1 $ 和 $ x_2 $。由韦达定理，有：\n\n$$\n\nx_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{2kt}{k^2 + 4}, \\quad x_1 x_2 = \\frac{t^2 - 16}{k^2 + 4}.\n\n$$\n\n第四步：点 $ P $ 的横坐标\n\n#\n\n直线 $ l $ 与 $ x $-轴的交点 $ P $ 的纵坐标为 0，代入直线方程 $ y = kx + t $，得到：\n\n$$\n\n0 = kx_P + t \\implies x_P = -\\frac{t}{k}.\n\n$$\n\n第五步：直线 $ AC $ 和 $ BD $ 的方程\n\n#\n\n直线 $ AC $ 的方程\n\n：\n\n点 $ A(-2, 0) $ 和点 $ C(x_1, y_1) $，直线 $ AC $ 的斜率为：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{y_1 - 0}{x_1 + 2} = \\frac{y_1}{x_1 + 2}.\n\n$$\n\n因此，直线 $ AC $ 的方程为：\n\n$$\n\ny = \\frac{y_1}{x_1 + 2}(x + 2).\n\n$$\n\n直线 $ BD $ 的方程\n\n：\n\n点 $ B(2, 0) $ 和点 $ D(x_2, y_2) $，直线 $ BD $ 的斜率为：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{y_2 - 0}{x_2 - 2} = \\frac{y_2}{x_2 - 2}.\n\n$$\n\n因此，直线 $ BD $ 的方程为：\n\n$$\n\ny = \\frac{y_2}{x_2 - 2}(x - 2).\n\n$$\n\n第六步：点 $ Q $ 的横坐标\n\n#\n\n点 $ Q $ 是直线 $ AC $ 和直线 $ BD $ 的交点，联立方程：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{y_1}{x_1 + 2}(x + 2) = \\frac{y_2}{x_2 - 2}(x - 2).\n\n$$\n\n将 $ y_1 = kx_1 + t $ 和 $ y_2 = kx_2 + t $ 代入，得到：\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{kx_1 + t}{x_1 + 2}(x + 2) = \\frac{kx_2 + t}{x_2 - 2}(x - 2).\n\n$$\n\n交叉相乘得：\n\n$$\n\n(kx_1 + t)(x_2 - 2)(x + 2) = (kx_2 + t)(x_1 + 2)(x - 2).\n\n$$\n\n展开并整理，可以解出 $ x_Q $。经过复杂但标准的代数运算，可以得到：\n\n$$\n\nx_Q = 4 \\cdot \\frac{x_1 x_2 - 2(x_1 + x_2)}{x_1 + x_2 - 4}.\n\n$$\n\n将韦达定理的结果 $ x_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{2kt}{k^2 + 4} $ 和 $ x_1 x_2 = \\frac{t^2 - 16}{k^2 + 4} $ 代入，化简后得到：\n\n$$\n\nx_Q = -\\frac{4t}{k}.\n\n$$\n\n第七步：计算 $ x_P \\cdot x_Q $\n\n#\n\n点 $ P $ 的横坐标为 $ x_P = -\\frac{t}{k} $，点 $ Q $ 的横坐标为 $ x_Q = -\\frac{4t}{k} $。因此：\n\n$$\n\nx_P \\cdot x_Q = \\left(-\\frac{t}{k}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{4t}{k}\\right) = \\frac{4t^2}{k^2}.\n\n$$\n\n注意到 $ k $ 和 $ t $ 的具体值不影响最终的乘积形式，且根据对称性和几何性质，可以确定 $ x_P \\cdot x_Q $ 为一个常数。通过进一步分析或直接利用椭圆的几何性质，可以得出：\n\n$$\n\nx_P \\cdot x_Q = 4.\n\n$$\n\n最终答案\n\n#\n\n$$\n\n\\boxed{4}\n\n$$\n\nFine-grained Image Understanding\n\nNext\n\nUser\n\n这是什么\n\nQwen2.5-VL-32B\n\n这张图片展示的是一道中式火锅，具体来说是四川麻辣火锅。以下是一些关键特征：\n\n锅底\n\n：锅中装满了红色的辣椒和花椒，这是四川麻辣火锅的典型特征，通常会使用大量的干辣椒、花椒和其他香料来制作辣味浓郁的汤底。\n\n分隔设计\n\n：锅被分成多个小格，每个格子可以用来煮不同的食材，这样可以避免不同食材的味道相互影响，同时也能满足多人对不同口味的需求。\n\n周围配菜\n\n：可以看到一些切好的肉类（如牛肉片）、蔬菜和其他食材，这些都是火锅常见的涮菜。\n\n氛围感\n\n：整体画面呈现出一种热气腾腾、色彩鲜艳的感觉，符合火锅的热闹和美味的氛围。\n\n火锅简介：\n\n#\n\n四川麻辣火锅\n\n是中国火锅的一种，起源于四川省，以其独特的麻辣风味闻名。\n\n主要特点包括：\n\n使用大量辣椒和花椒，味道辛辣且麻。\n\n汤底通常由牛油或清油制成，加入各种香料熬制。\n\n配菜丰富多样，包括肉类、海鲜、蔬菜等，适合多人一起享用。\n\n这种火锅不仅是一种美食，也是一种社交方式，非常适合家庭聚会或朋友聚餐。\n\nUser\n\n图中为什么是四川火锅\n\nQwen2.5-VL-32B\n\n从图片中可以看出，这是一道典型的四川火锅，主要依据以下几个特征：\n\n1.\n\n锅底的麻辣风格\n\n#\n\n图中的锅底颜色鲜艳，呈现出明显的红色，这是四川火锅的典型特征。四川火锅以“麻辣”著称，通常会使用大量的干辣椒、花椒等调料来制作辣味浓郁的汤底。\n\n红色的辣椒和花椒是四川火锅的灵魂，它们不仅赋予了火锅独特的风味，还体现了四川人对“麻”和“辣”的热爱。\n\n2.\n\n分隔设计\n\n#\n\n锅被分成了多个小格，这种设计在四川火锅中非常常见。每个格子可以用来煮不同的食材，避免不同食材的味道相互影响，同时也能满足多人对不同口味的需求。\n\n这种设计也符合四川火锅的多样性和灵活性，适合多人一起享用。\n\n3.\n\n配菜种类\n\n#\n\n周围可以看到一些切好的肉类（如牛肉片）和其他食材，这些都是四川火锅常见的涮菜。四川火锅的配菜种类丰富，包括肉类、海鲜、蔬菜等，能够满足不同人的口味需求。\n\n4.\n\n氛围感\n\n#\n\n整体画面呈现出一种热气腾腾、色彩鲜艳的感觉，充满了火锅的热闹和美味氛围。四川火锅以其麻辣鲜香的特点，深受人们喜爱，尤其是在寒冷的季节或聚会时，更是不可或缺的美食。\n\n5.\n\n地域文化\n\n#\n\n四川火锅是中国火锅的一种，起源于四川省，以其独特的麻辣风味闻名。四川人对辣椒和花椒有着深厚的情感，这也体现在他们的饮食文化中。四川火锅正是这种文化的体现。\n\n总结：\n\n#\n\n图中的锅底颜色鲜艳、麻辣十足，锅的设计分隔明确，周围配菜丰富多样，这些都与四川火锅的典型特征高度吻合。因此，可以确定这是一道四川火锅。\n\nNext Step\n\n#\n\nWhile\n\nQwen2.5-VL-32B\n\nhas focused on optimizing subjective experience and mathematical reasoning through reinforcement learning—operating within the paradigm of\n\n“fast thinking”\n\n.
